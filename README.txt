#How to run the code

Recommended Python : Python 3

Recommended IDE : SPYDER

Imported Libraries : Numpy , Opencv

1> Important Note : The code can take a long time if start and goal nodes are on extreme corners on the map. Running the code on a high specifications machine might 
cut the time significantly.

2> Please make sure to import the right libraries.

3> Please note that the Origin is at the left bottom position (Cartesian Space Origin) when giving input points.

4> Visualization is saved as a .avi file in the same directory as the code.

5> If the saved video file is not displaying the video correctly, then it's the problem of the media player. Try running the video in a different media player. 

6> The visualization begins after the goal is reached and then the video starts writing on file. So, if the nodes are far apart, then this process might take time.

7> Please make sure the start and goal points are not in obstacle space or out of map boundary.
